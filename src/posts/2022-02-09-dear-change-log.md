A changelog is like a captains log for your repo. It is a simplified breakdown of the features, fixes, bugs or other types of updates that were made and merged into your main branch.

Creating changelogs will illustrate the importance of good commit messages. To get into a good habit with commit messages I would recommend using some form of commit helper extension. For example, if you use VScode you could use [Commitizen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen) extension.
