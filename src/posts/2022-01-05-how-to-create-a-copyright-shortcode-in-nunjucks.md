In this brief post I'll describe the process of automating your website copyright notice with Eleventy (11ty).

## Intro

11ty is a popular static site generator you can use with a templating language to build a website as a set of static files. The beauty of this is that you can use data from API's and files at build time to create your pages. This also,  means that you can trigger a fresh build each time your data changes.

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is one such templating language. Others examples are [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) or [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). Shortcodes are a feature of 11ty where it extends the templating language to allow you to declare and use functions you define that generate customer HTML. For example:

```javascript
function myCustomSnipper(value){
    return `<h1>Get me ${value} dognuts</h1>`
}
```

## Copyright Notices

What follows is not legal advice, please do your own research. Although not mandatory a copy right notice can protect and deter people from stealing you content. Having one costs nothing so why not? Many website typically place their notice in their footer so that it is visible on every page. Copyright notices are typically formatted like this `Copyright Â© [Year] [Copyright owners name]`

## Building it

Within a file of the same name lets create our copyright notice generator.

```javascript
/**
 * 
 * @param {string} content the copyright owner 
 * @returns 
 */
function copyrightNoticeShortcode(content) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  
  return `<small>
        Copyright\&copy; ${currentYear} ${content}. All Rights Reserved
      </small>`;
}

module.exports = copyrightNoticeShortcode;

```

Now lets add this to 11ty's configuration file `.eleventy.js`
